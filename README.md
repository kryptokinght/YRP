*Run using pyhton local server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000`*

**REASON**:Opening the page locally (ie not on a server) and trying load a file alongside remote files (file:// Vs https://), causes the error message **`Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https`**. Chrome is seeing that you‚Äôre trying to load a local file (app.js) alongside remote files and blocking loading, it‚Äôs the browser security kicking in.

You can get around this by running it on a server - there are various ways to do this. Possibly easiest way, especially if you are on a Mac/Linux where it will be available without any installing, is to use Python‚Äôs SimpleHTTPServer - http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python 34. You run the command in the folder with your code in, and it starts a server up from that folder. This works for me when I run it.




### Run a simple HTTP server
